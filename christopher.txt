How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower somehow defeat a global superpower? 
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love whos unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin, confoundin the British henchmen Everyone give it up for Americas favorite fighting Frenchman!

LAFAYETTE!
